1. Implement a method to generate the sequence of Fibonacci numbers using block iterator yield.

2. Develop a generic class, the Queue collection, implements the basic operations for a queue, as well as providing the ability to iterate by implementing an iterator "manually" (without the yield iterator block). Test methods developed class.
